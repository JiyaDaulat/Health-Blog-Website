            <p id="mh2"> According to <u id="f1"><font color="#0267e3">World Health Organization (WHO),</font></u> Mental Health is a "State of Well-being in which the individual realizes his or her Abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work Productively and Fruitfully, and can contribute to his or her Community".</p>

            <h1 id="mh3">HISTORY OF MENTAL HEALTH</h1>
            <br>

            <div id="mh4">&#xf0a4;In the mid-19th century, <b>William Sweetser</b> was the first to coin the term Mental Hygiene, which can be seen as the precursor to contemporary approaches to work on promoting positive Mental Health. <b>Isaac Ray</b>, the <u id="u2" color="#ac00ff"><font color="#ac00ff">fourth president of the American Psychiatric Association</u></font> and one of its founders, further defined Mental Hygiene as "The Art Of Preserving The Mind Against All Incidents and Influences calculated to Deteriorate Its Qualities, Impair its Energies, or Derange Its Movements".
<br>
<br>
<b>&#xf0a4;</b>In American history, mentally ill patients were thought to be religiously punished. This response persisted through the <font color="#c4413b">1700s,</font> along with the inhumane confinement and stigmatization of such individuals.<u id="u3"color="#c4413b"><font color="#c4413b"> Dorothea Dix (1802–1887)</u></font> was an important figure in the development of the "Mental Hygiene" movement. Dix was a school teacher who endeavored to help people with mental disorders and to expose the sub-standard conditions into which they were put.This became known as the "Mental Hygiene Movement"</div>

<p id="mh5">How Can You Cultivate Your Mental Health?</p><br>
<p id="mh6"><font color="black">&#8594;</font>Your mental health is shaped by social, economic, genetic and environmental conditions. To improve mental health within society at large, we need to address the social determinants of poor mental health, including poverty, economic insecurity, unemployment, low education, social disadvantage, homelessness and social isolation.<br>
<font color="black">&#8594;</font><p id="mh12">On an individual level, there are steps you can take to optimise your mental health. The first step is identifying your existing support networks and the coping strategies that you’ve used in the past.<br>

There are also small things you can do to improve your mental health and help you to cope in tough times, such as:</p>
<br>
<h2 class="mh11">1. helping others.</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="mh11">2. finding a type of exercise or physical activity you enjoy (like yoga).</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="mh11">3. getting good sleep.</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="mh11">4. eating healthy food.</h2>
<br>

<br>
<h2 class="mh11">6.learning strategies to manage stress.</h2>

<br>
<h2 class="mh11">8. learning ways to relax (such as meditation).</h2>
<br>
<h2 class="mh11">9. counteracting negative or overcritical thinking.</h2>
