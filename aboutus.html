            	<div id="box2">Hello, and welcome! I’m Jiya Daulat, founder of Health Blog.

For p6 years, I’ve been working as a health & medical writer. First I was employed, working for different medical companies including the British Medical Journal and Elsevier, then I went freelance. I’ve since worked for various healthcare brands and businesses – hospitals, government, health professionals, pharmaceutical brands, insurers and more.
I’ve written about pretty much any health topic you can think of..
Why? It’s simple – I’m passionate about inspiring behaviour change through effective communication. I believe high-quality health writing plays a significant role in creating better public health.
 That’s why I’m so excited about AI. I see the tremendous potential of this technology to help health & medical writers become more productive while still maintaining quality and accuracy in health communication.</div>
