<h1 id="history"> HISTORY</h1>
<p id="f5">In the <b>1940s, an emigrant M.D. from Austria named Hans Kraus began</b> testing children in the U.S. and Europe for what he termed, "Muscular Fitness." (in other words, muscular functionality) Through his testing, he found children in the U.S. to be far less physically capable than European children. Kraus published some alarming papers in various journals and got the attention of some powerful people, including a senator from Pennsylvania who took the findings to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. President Eisenhower was "shocked." He set up a series of conferences and committees; then in July 1956, Eisenhower established the President's Council on Youth Fitness.<br>
<font color="#120102">Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, to improve immune system function, and to meet emergency situations</font></p>

	<h2 id="ex1">1.AEROBIC EXERCISE</h2>
	<p id="ex2"><font size="20px">&#8594;</font>Aerobic exercise is a light-to-moderate-intensity activity where you use large muscle groups, like your legs and glutes, simultaneously and often rhythmically for more than two minutes without gasping for air.</p><br>
 <table border="0">                   
<td><p id="a1">i.JOGGING :</p><p class="A1">Running at a steady and gentle pace.This form of exercise is great for maintaining weight and building a cardiovascular base to later perform more intense exercises.</p>
<p id="a2">ii.WORKING ON ELLIPTICAL TRAINER :</p><p class="A1">This is a stationary exercise machine used to perform walking,<br>or running without causing excessive stress on the joints.
This form of exercise is perfect for people with achy hips, knees, and ankles.</p>
<p id="a6">iii.CYCLING :</p><p class="A1">Riding a bicycle typically involves longer distances than walking or jogging. This is another low-impact exercise on the joints and is great for improving leg strength.</p>
<p id="a3">iv.WALKING : </p><p class="A1">Moving at a fairly regular pace for a short, medium or long distance.</p>

<h2 id="ex3">2.ANAEROBIC EXERCISE</h2>
<p id="ex2"><font size="20px">&#8594;</font> Anaerobic Exercise is a fast, high-intensity exercise that does not require the body to utilize oxygen to produce energy. It helps to promote strength, endurance, speed, and power; and is used by bodybuilders to build workout intensity.</p><br>
<p id="Prominent">Prominent examples of anaerobic exercises include:</p>
<table border="0">
<td><p id="a7">WEIGHT TRAINING :</p><p class ="A1"> A common type of strength training for developing the strength and size of skeletal muscles.</p>
<p id="a8">ISOMETRIC EXERCISE :</p><p class ="A1"> Helps to maintain strength. A muscle action in which no visible movement occurs and the resistance matches the muscular tension.</p>
<p id="a9">SPRINTING :</p> <p class ="A1">Running short distances as fast as possible, training for muscle explosiveness.</p></td>
<td><p id="box">
<img src="images/weight.jpg"height="300"width="600"> <br></p></td>
